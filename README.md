# Hi! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a Georgia Tech computer scientist with a keen interest in machine learning, data science, and robotics. To learn more about my experience, please visit my [website](https://juanrobledo12.github.io/).

## Projects
* [Spotify Songs Mood Classifier](https://github.com/JuanRobledo12/cse6242-project): A Data Science project that aims to create a large, labeled dataset of songs categorized by mood using machine learning. This dataset can then be utilized for various applications, such as playlist generation.
* [Simulated Annealing Algorithm ](https://github.com/JuanRobledo12/gatech-algorithms-project): This project involves a custom Python implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem. The goal is to gain a better understanding of local search algorithms.
* [Diabetes Prediction Project](https://github.com/JuanRobledo12/gatech-ml-project): A Machine Learning project that aims to test different classification models to predict if a person has diabetes or not based on several health indicators.
* [Stretch 2 Manipulation Package](https://github.com/gt-rail-internal/rerail_stretchit_manipulation): A ROS package for autonomous manipulation using the Stretch 2 robot.
* [Blue Stretch](https://github.com/JuanRobledo12/blue_stretch): An autonomous system developed in ROS to track objects in homes using the Stretch 2 robot to assist older adults in locating misplaced items.
* [3DOF DIY Robotic Arm](https://github.com/JuanRobledo12/karasu): A DIY robot arm controlled wirelessly using MQTT protocol, capable of moving the end effector to a desired position through inverse kinematics.

## Technologies & Tools
